We are adding two numbers and testing whether the generated result from **addNumbers** method in **Calculator** class is correct or not. <br />

Inside the **shouldAnswerWithTrue** method in **AppTest** class call the **addNumbers** with parameters 3 and 5. Assert whether the generated result is equal to 8 or not.
