# Description
The project was taken up as a part of the course work for CSC 510 Software Engineering during Masters. The project aims at creating a microservice, build it ground up and understand various aspects of software development in the industry.

We designed a one-stop marketplace that helps the customers buy wallpapers. New users can use the sign-up functinality to create an account.
 
There are 2 allowed roles in the system :  
- Admin - Has capability of performing CRUD operations on wallpapers. This allows him to add/remove different wallpapers as well as classify them into categories.

- Buyer/User - Has the capability of selecting a wallpaper and proceeding to checkout by adding it to cart.

# Tech stack
We have used the MERN stack, a free and open-source JavaScript software stack for building dynamic full-stack web applications. This involves using:  
- MongoDB : A document-oriented, No-SQL database used to store the application data.

- ExpressJS : A framework layered on top of NodeJS, used to build the backend of a site using NodeJS functions and structures.

- ReactJS : A library used to build UI components that create the user interface of the single page web application.

- NodeJS : The JavaScript runtime environment. It is used to run JavaScript on a machine rather than in a browser.  

# Software used
- Code development: We use visual studio code. Installation steps can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

- Database: We use MongoDB community edition as the database for the project. Installation steps can be found [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/)

- Testing: We use Postman to test backend APIs. Installation steps can be found [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

- Database View: We use Studio3T to check the data stored in the database. Installation steps can be found [here](https://studio3t.com/download/)
