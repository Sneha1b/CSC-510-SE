|Notes|Self Assessment (Total:)|Evidence|
|-----|---------------|--------|
|Video|3|https://github.com/ekanshsinghal/se-group26-proj1#readme| 
|Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others... but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)|3|https://github.com/Sneha1b/CSC-510-SE/graphs/contributors|
|Number of commits|3|https://github.com/Sneha1b/CSC-510-SE/pulse|
|Number of commits: by different people|3|https://github.com/Sneha1b/CSC-510-SE/pulse|
|Issues reports: there are **many**|3|https://github.com/Sneha1b/CSC-510-SE/issues|
|Issues are being closed|3|https://github.com/Sneha1b/CSC-510-SE/issues|
|DOI badge: exists|3|https://github.com/Sneha1b/CSC-510-SE/blob/main/README.md|
|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly |3|https://github.com/ekanshsinghal/se-group26-proj1/tree/main/docs|
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) |3|Description given in code comments|
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|3|Refer README.md files in frontend and backend folder|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|3|https://github.com/Sneha1b/CSC-510-SE/blob/main/README.md|
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|3|https://github.com/Sneha1b/CSC-510-SE/blob/main/README.md|
|Use of version control tools|3|
|Use of style checkers |3| 
|Use of code formatters. |3|Prettier code formatter used|
|Use of syntax checkers. |3|ESlint (Babel) used|
|Use of code coverage |3|https://github.com/Sneha1b/CSC-510-SE/blob/main/backend_node/Test%20Results%20-%20Backend_Test.html|
|Other automated analysis tools|3| SonarCloud, Build Action, Lint used-https://github.com/Sneha1b/CSC-510-SE/tree/main/.github/workflows|
|Test cases exist|3|https://github.com/Sneha1b/CSC-510-SE/tree/main/backend_node/test|
|Test cases are routinely executed|3|https://github.com/Sneha1b/CSC-510-SE/actions|
|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up|3|https://github.com/Sneha1b/CSC-510-SE/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md|
|Issues are discussed before they are closed, even if you discuss in slack, need a sumamry statement here|3|Issues are discussed over Whatsapp group but we also use github issues to keep track.|
|Chat channel: exists|3|Yes. Whatsapp group exists.|
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|3|https://github.com/Sneha1b/CSC-510-SE/issues|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files|3| Yes, everyone used the same tech stack and software used mentioned in README file.|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|3|Yes, everyone used the same tech stack and software used mentioned in README file.|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|3|
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base|3|
|Short release cycles |3|https://github.com/Sneha1b/CSC-510-SE|
